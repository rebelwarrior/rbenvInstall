# Install rbenv Script

This small script will install [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv "rbenv github page") and [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build "ruby-build github page") as a plugin for rbenv and installs ruby 1.9.3.

This set-up is perfect for a small HDD space computer like one with an SSD, because it doesn't require an xcode to be installed (unlike rvm which does). 

It requires `git` installed to work.

Make sure you don't have rvm in your computer or use the command `rvm implode` to remove it.
